<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Victoria</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a Full Stack developer from Argentina</h3>
<p>
 I also have a bachelor's degree in Industrial Design. I'm passionate about technology, product design and user experience. I believe designs and ideas should be considered from a multidisciplinary approach to achieve integral solutions. </p>
 
<p> I am a self-taught programmer who likes taking up new challenges and finding practical solutions in team oriented environments.
Creativity and adaptability are my main strengths. What I particularly like about the IT world is the team collaboration and the "geekiness" of the people I got to know from it.
